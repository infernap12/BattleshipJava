Ideas for extension.

AI that makes random moves until it hits
if it has a hit, it tries to chase the line until it gets a sink, and will remember which line lengths are dead, and know when to stop.
Maybe different levels of AI that remember less stuff?

UI when I learn that i guess.

Networking?
that could be fun, or horrible

Gamerule extensions:
Salvo mode?
Larger map, more ships?
Movement after X turns// AI for that would be interesting. Do weights based on probabilties that something has moved?
